I need to implement CPMS API features to support osl-agent-prototype integration.

Context: The osl-agent-prototype needs CPMS for form pattern detection. The agent-side integration is ready, but CPMS needs to provide specific APIs.

Please:
1. Review docs/cpms-repo-tasks.md for full requirements
2. Examine the current CPMS repository (github.com/lehelkovach/cpms)
3. Identify what's already implemented vs what needs to be added
4. Start with Task 1: Implement/verify Pattern Matching API endpoint

The agent expects:
- POST endpoint for pattern matching (match_pattern)
- Request: HTML + screenshot/observation
- Response: Pattern data with fields (email, password, submit), selectors, confidence scores

Key requirements:
- Detect login forms (email + password + submit)
- Extract CSS selectors and XPath
- Return structured pattern data matching format in cpms-repo-tasks.md
- Support pattern storage/retrieval for reuse

Also need to update cpms-client Python package with:
- match_pattern() method matching expected signature
- Pattern storage methods (create_pattern, get_pattern, list_patterns)

Let's start by examining the current CPMS codebase structure and API endpoints, then implement what's missing.
