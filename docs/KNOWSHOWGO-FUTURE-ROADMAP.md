## Part 7: Revenue Projections

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Target | Price | Features |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | Developers | $0 | 10K concepts, community support |
| **Pro** | Startups/Indie | $49/mo | 500K concepts, API access |
| **Growth** | AI Startups | $299/mo | 5M concepts, priority support |
| **Scale** | AI Companies | $999/mo | 50M concepts, SLA, SSO |
| **Enterprise** | Large orgs | $5K-50K/mo | Unlimited, dedicated, on-prem |

### 5-Year Revenue Model (AI Agent Memory Focus)

**Target Market**: AI Agent Memory ($100B+ by 2030)
- Every AI agent needs persistent memory
- LangChain alone: 100K+ weekly downloads, millions of projects
- AutoGPT: 150K+ GitHub stars, massive deployment base
- Enterprise AI adoption exploding - every company building agents
- Memory-as-a-Service is **completely underserved** - no clear leader

| Year | Focus | ARR Target | Key Metrics |
|------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | LangChain + viral growth | **$8M** | 20K paying, 200K free, 1M API calls/day |
| 2 | Platform standard | **$40M** | 100K paying, all major frameworks |
| 3 | Enterprise dominance | **$120M** | 500 enterprise, 300K SMB |
| 4 | Global infrastructure | **$300M** | 2000 enterprise, market leader |
| 5 | Platform monopoly | **$500M+** | IPO at $5B+, category creator |

### Why These Numbers Are Conservative

**Comparison to recent hypergrowth:**
- **Pinecone**: $100M ARR in ~3 years, $750M valuation → $4B (vector DB - we do more)
- **Supabase**: $0 → $80M ARR in 3 years (backend-as-service)
- **Vercel**: $0 → $100M+ ARR in 4 years (deployment)
- **Cursor**: Explosive growth, $400M valuation in 2 years (AI coding)

**The Agent Memory market is BIGGER than all of these:**
- Every AI agent = needs memory (100% attach rate)
- Agents are the next platform (like mobile was)
- No incumbent (Pinecone is vectors only, Neo4j is graphs only)
- We are **graphs + vectors + procedures + patterns** = complete solution

**Unit Economics (Year 3):**
```
Conservative scenario:
- 1M registered developers (LangChain has more)
- 30% activate (300K)
- 10% convert to paid (30K) 
- Average $300/mo = $108M ARR
- Plus 500 enterprise × $20K/mo = $120M ARR
- Total: $228M (we're saying $120M = conservative)

Aggressive scenario:
- First-mover in $100B market
- Network effects (shared ontologies)
- Platform lock-in (procedures don't transfer)
- Could be $300M+ Year 3
```

**Why we win:**
1. **Only complete solution** - competitors do 1 thing, we do 4
2. **Procedure learning** - unique, patentable, massive moat
3. **Network effects** - shared patterns get better with scale
4. **Agent-native** - built for agents, not retrofitted databases
