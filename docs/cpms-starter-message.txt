I need to implement CPMS integration for form pattern detection. 

Context: This is the osl-agent-prototype project. The agent-side integration is ready, but CPMS-specific implementation is needed.

Please:
1. Read docs/cpms-quickstart.md for immediate first steps
2. Review docs/cpms-integration-plan.md for full task breakdown
3. Start with Task 1: Implement full CPMS pattern matching API integration in src/personal_assistant/cpms_adapter.py

The current detect_form_pattern() method has a fallback implementation but needs to call the real CPMS API. I need to:
- Investigate the CPMS API (github.com/lehelkovach/cpms) to understand match_pattern endpoint
- Build observations from HTML + screenshots in CPMS format
- Call CPMS API and parse the response
- Return structured pattern data matching the format in the integration plan

Key files:
- src/personal_assistant/cpms_adapter.py (main work location)
- The agent already has cpms.detect_form tool wired up
- KnowShowGo pattern storage (ksg.store_cpms_pattern) is already implemented

Let's start by examining the CPMS repository and understanding the API, then implement the integration.
